# Game of Life

## Description
The "Game of Life" is a Java-based implementation of John Conway's Game of Life, a cellular automaton that simulates the life cycle of cells. This graphical application, built with the Swing framework, allows users to observe complex patterns emerge and evolve in a grid as the cells interact according to predefined rules.

## Features
- **Dynamic Grid:** Watch cells live, die, and multiply in a grid.
- **Interactive Controls:** Pause, resume, and reset the game.
- **Generation Tracking:** View the current generation number and the count of alive cells.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust simulation settings such as the speed of generations.

## Usage
After starting the application, use the control panel at the bottom of the window to interact with the simulation:
- **Pause/Resume:** Toggle the simulation's running state.
- **Reset:** Reset the grid to its initial state.
